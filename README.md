ROUTER_SYSTEM_MESSAGE # System prompt for intent classification
```

## Starting the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server
Start the FastAPI backend server:
```bash
uvicorn src.services.service:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Launch the User Interface
In a new terminal, start the Streamlit frontend:
```bash
streamlit run src/ui/chat.py
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend UI: http://localhost:8501
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000

## Usage Guide

The application consists of two main tabs:

### Chat Tab
This is where you interact with the AI system:

1. **Image Generation**
   ```plaintext
   User: "Create an image of a sunset over mountains"
   ```
   - The system will display the generated image
   - Generation typically takes 10-20 seconds
   - Images are displayed directly in the chat

2. **Music Generation**
   ```plaintext
   User: "Make me a happy song about summer"
   ```
   - An audio player will appear with the generated song
   - Generation typically takes 30-60 seconds
   - Songs can be played, paused, and downloaded

3. **Research Generation**
   ```plaintext
   User: "Research the impact of AI on healthcare"
   ```
   - Research content streams in real-time
   - You'll see the text appear progressively
   - Final output is formatted as a complete research paper

### Cost Monitoring Tab
Tracks usage and costs:
- Current budget usage
- Cost per service type
- Number of generations
- Remaining budget

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a clean, modular architecture:

### Frontend Layer (`app.py`)
- Built with Streamlit
- Handles user interface and interactions
- Manages chat history and media display
- Streams content updates to UI

### Backend Service (`service.py`)
- FastAPI-based REST API
- Handles content generation requests
- Manages streaming responses
- Implements logging and error handling

### Router System
- Two implementations:
  1. `MockRouter`: For development/testing
  2. `OpenAIRouter`: For production use
- Intelligently routes requests to appropriate generators

### Content Generators
1. **Image Generator**
   - `FluxImageGenerator`: Uses Flux API
   - `MockImageGenerator`: For testing
   - Handles image prompt processing and generation

2. **Song Generator**
   - `SunoSongGenerator`: Uses Suno API
   - `MockSongGenerator`: For testing
   - Manages audio generation and processing

3. **Research Generator**
   - `OpenAIResearchGenerator`: Uses OpenAI API
   - `MockResearchGenerator`: For testing
   - Implements streaming response generation

### Base Classes (`base.py`)
- `ContentGeneratorBase`: Abstract base for all generators
- `RouterBase`: Abstract base for routing systems
- `ContentType`: Enum for content types
- Defines common interfaces and types

### Configuration System (`config.py`)
- Centralizes configuration management
- Handles environment variables
- Manages API keys and settings

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- API failures
- Budget limits
- Invalid requests
- Network issues

## Cost Management

Service costs per request:
- Image Generation: $0.04
- Song Generation: $0.05
- Research Generation: $0.01

The system actively tracks usage and ensures operations stay within budget.
