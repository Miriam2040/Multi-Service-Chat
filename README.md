## Starting the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server
Start the FastAPI backend server:
```bash
uvicorn src.services.service:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Launch the User Interface
In a new terminal, start the Streamlit frontend:
```bash
streamlit run src/ui/chat.py
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend UI: http://localhost:8501
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000

## Usage Guide

The application consists of two main tabs:

### Chat Tab
This is where you interact with the AI system:

1. **Image Generation**
   ```plaintext
   User: "Create an image of a moon and cat"
   ```
   - The system will display the generated image
   - Generation typically takes 10-20 seconds
   - Images are displayed directly in the chat
  
   ![Project Banner](examples/user_chat_image_generated.PNG)

2. **Music Generation**
   ```plaintext
   User: "Make me a song about sun"
   ```
   - An audio player will appear with the generated song
   - Generation typically takes 30-60 seconds
   - Songs can be played, paused, and downloaded

    ![Project Banner](examples/chat_song.PNG)

3. **Research Generation**
   ```plaintext
   User: "I want research paper about google"
   ```
   - Research content streams in real-time
   - You'll see the text appear progressively
   - Final output is formatted as a complete research paper

### Cost Monitoring Tab
Tracks usage and costs:
- Current budget usage
- Remaining budget
- Cost per service type
- latest transactions

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a clean, modular architecture:

### Frontend Layer (`app.py`)
- Built with Streamlit
- Handles user interface and interactions
- Manages chat history and media display
- Streams content updates to UI

### Backend Service (`service.py`)
- FastAPI-based REST API
- Handles content generation requests
- Manages streaming responses
- Implements logging and error handling

### Router System
- Two implementations:
  1. `MockRouter`: For development/testing
  2. `OpenAIRouter`: For production use, using model to classify user propmt to the right categoy
- Intelligently routes requests to appropriate generators

### Content Generators
1. **Image Generator**
   - `FluxImageGenerator`: Uses Flux API
   - `MockImageGenerator`: For testing
   - Handles image prompt processing and generation

2. **Song Generator**
   - `SunoSongGenerator`: Uses Suno API
   - `MockSongGenerator`: For testing
   - Manages audio generation and processing

3. **Research Generator**
   - `OpenAIResearchGenerator`: Uses OpenAI API
   - `MockResearchGenerator`: For testing
   - Implements streaming response generation

### Base Classes (`base.py`)
- `ContentGeneratorBase`: Abstract base for all generators
- `RouterBase`: Abstract base for routing systems
- `ContentType`: Enum for content types
- Defines common interfaces and types

### Configuration System (`config.py`)
- Centralizes configuration management
- Handles environment variables
- Manages API keys and settings

### Cost Tracking System
- **Budget Management**
  - Tracks overall budget limit from config
  - Maintains running total of expenses
  - Prevents operations when budget is exceeded

- **Per-Service Cost Tracking**
  - Image Generation: $0.04 per request
  - Song Generation: $0.05 per request
  - Research Generation: $0.01 per request
  - Routing: $0.01 per request

- **Implementation Details**
  - Each generator implements `get_price()` method
  - Costs are tracked before API calls
  - Real-time budget updates
  - Cost monitoring dashboard in UI

- **Transaction Storage**
  - All transactions are saved to disk in JSON format
  - Located at `data/costs/costs.json`
  - Each transaction includes timestamp, service type, cost, and status
  - Example transaction record:
    ```json
    {
       {
        "id": "b05eeb81-b5a6-4df0-b4ca-f8129ffca258",
        "timestamp": "2025-01-02T10:30:03.892170",
        "type": "SunoSongGenerator",
        "cost": 0.05,
        "prompt": "create a song aboout the moon"
      },
      {
        "id": "2743f7cf-159c-4135-ab60-bed1e9cbfbc1",
        "timestamp": "2025-01-02T10:38:11.561070",
        "type": "OpenAIRouter",
        "cost": 0.01,
        "prompt": "hi"
      },
      {
        "id": "ced87ccf-f580-4dfd-9b66-2d0d3e4593f5",
        "timestamp": "2025-01-02T10:38:11.568626",
        "type": "OpenAIResearchGenerator",
        "cost": 0.01,
        "prompt": "hi"
      }
    }
   
- **Cost Optimization**
  - DEV mode for testing without costs
  - Usage analytics for cost optimization
